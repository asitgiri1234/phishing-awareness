# PhishGuard  
**Real-Time Phishing Awareness System Using NLP**

PhishGuard is a lightweight and extensible phishing detection system designed to analyze messages and classify them as *phishing* or *legitimate*.  
This repository currently contains the **Phase-1 codebase**, which includes a basic preprocessing pipeline, dummy model prediction, and a minimal Flask web demo.

Future phases will introduce:
- TF-IDF based NLP model  
- Logistic Regression / SVM classifier  
- Real-time detection API  
- Advanced preprocessing  
- Explainable AI features
